# calcos version 3.3.8

This release of calcos needs to be synchronized with activation of context
`hst_0767.pmap`, which has the two new COS TDSTAB reference files.  The new
version of calcos (`3.3.8`) won't work with the old versions of the reference
files (`hst_0764.pmap`), and the old version of calcos (`3.3.7`) won't work with
the new (`hst_0767.pmap`) reference files.
